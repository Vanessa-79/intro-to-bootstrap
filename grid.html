            <div class="col-sm-6">Uganda,[b] officially the Republic of
                Uganda,[c] is a landlocked country in East Africa. The country is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the
                north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda,
                and to the south by Tanzania. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake
                Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region, lies within the
                Nile basin, and has a varied but generally modified equatorial climate. As of 2023, it has a population
                of around 49.6 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala.

                Uganda is named after the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the
                country, including the capital Kampala, and whose language Luganda is widely spoken throughout the
                country. From 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the United Kingdom, which established
                administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. The
                period since then has been marked by violent conflicts, including an eight-year-long military
                dictatorship led by Idi Amin.</div>
